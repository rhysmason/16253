# to use a veriable you need a word like hello
# then you get the command you need like "Hello"
# look

hello = "Hello"

print(hello)

# you want to make a sentence you will need to do this
# of corse put what ever you want 

p1 = "How are you today? "
p2 = "\n"

# \n means new line

p3 = "I am ok, you?"

# then put the print  command

print(p1, p2, p3)

# the commer means a new veriable 
# save then run it! 

# Lets learn about the print command a bit more!
# so a print command in python is basically when 
# you want to print it to the consle (cmd or terminal)
# you can put print("\n") to make a new line
# you can also put plain text in there
# by doing print("Hey how are you?")
# here is an example:

print("How was your day?", "\n", p3)

# you can also add veriables!
# now save and run it!
# to disable a command you can put a
# "#" in front of it like this;

#print("Great, thanks for asking!")

# now look!

# this will be in the discription to download 
# but thank you for watcing and see you later!
# bye!
